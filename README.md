# Sezzle Challenge

## Description

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to demonstrate a portion of my skills here. I tried to hit the requirements as literally as possible, such as eliminating white space in the expression part of the logged history, and not letting underscores get in the way of the calculation. Socket.io allows users on separate machines to see the updated log right away.

## The Challenge

A calculator website which logs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the website. For example, user A and user B go to your site at the same time. User A calculates "5 + 5", which equals "10". This is logged below the calculator as "5+5 = 10". User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it. Now, user B calculates "3x_4". This calculates to 12 and displays "3x_4=12" right below the prior calculation. User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it. Results should remain between sessions. Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest. Once the calculator is completed, send me the URL for your application.
